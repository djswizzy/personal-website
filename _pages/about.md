I am a computational astrophysicist completing my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley and North Carolina State University, specializing in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of core-collapse supernovae. My research explores the role of turbulent plasma flow in supernova evolution using high-fidelity 3D simulations on distributed HPC systems.

## Research Focus

My dissertation research investigates the magnetohydrodynamics of 3D core-collapse supernovae. Through advanced numerical simulations, I study how magnetic fields and turbulent plasma dynamics influence the explosion mechanism and evolution of massive stars at the end of their lives.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and plasma dynamics
- Core-collapse supernova simulations
- Turbulence in astrophysical flows
- High-performance computing and numerical methods

## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages:** Python, FORTRAN, C++, MATLAB, CUDA, Bash  
**HPC & Parallel Computing:** MPI, OpenMP, OpenACC, distributed computing  
**Tools:** Docker, Git, VS Code, LabView, Autodesk Fusion  
**Scientific Computing:** NumPy, SciPy, mpi4py, large data analytics, statistical analysis

## Professional Experience

Beyond academia, I have experience in software engineering and systems administration:

- **Software Engineer** at KOINSLOT Inc., developing educational coding hardware
- **App Developer** at Kondra Chemical, building LabView applications for chemical analysis
- **Business Systems Analyst** at Insightsoftware, executing data migrations
- **IT Systems Administrator** at NC State Physics Department
