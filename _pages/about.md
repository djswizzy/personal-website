I am a computational astrophysicist who recently completed my Ph.D. from North Carolina State University, and I am currently a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley. I specialize in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of core-collapse supernovae. My research explores the role of turbulent plasma flow in supernova evolution using high-fidelity 3D simulations on distributed HPC systems.

## Research Focus

My dissertation research investigates the magnetohydrodynamics of 3D core-collapse supernovae. Through advanced numerical simulations, I study how magnetic fields and turbulent plasma dynamics influence the explosion mechanism and evolution of massive stars at the end of their lives.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and plasma dynamics
- Core-collapse supernova simulations
- Turbulence in astrophysical flows
- High-performance computing and numerical methods
