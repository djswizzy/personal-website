I am a computational astrophysicist who recently completed my Ph.D. from North Carolina State University and am currently a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley. I specialize in multiphysics modeling, high-performance computing, software development, and large data analysis, with experience in software engineering, systems administration, and machine learning.

## Research Focus

My dissertation research investigates the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of 3D core-collapse supernovae. Through numerical simulations, I study how magnetic fields and turbulent plasma dynamics influence the explosion mechanism and evolution of massive stars at the end of their lives.

**Key Research Areas:**
- Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and plasma dynamics
- Core-collapse supernova simulations
- Turbulence in astrophysical flows
- High-performance computing and numerical methods
- Quantum neutrino flavor oscillations

## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages:** Python, FORTRAN, C++, MATLAB, CUDA, Bash  
**HPC & Parallel Computing:** MPI, OpenMP, OpenACC, SLURM, distributed computing, GPU computing  
**Scientific Computing:** NumPy, SciPy, mpi4py, numerical methods, PDEs/ODEs, large-scale data analysis, statistical analysis  
**Performance & Debugging:** profiling/optimization, vectorization, memory/performance tuning, reproducibility  
**Software Engineering:** Git, CI/CD, unit testing, documentation, code review  
**Tools:** Docker, Linux, VS Code, LabView, Autodesk Fusion

## Professional Experience

Beyond academia, I have experience in software engineering and systems administration:

- **Software Engineer** at KOINSLOT Inc., developing educational coding hardware
- **App Developer** at Kondra Chemical, building a full LabView application for chemical analysis and hardware control
- **Business Systems Analyst** at Insightsoftware, building and administrating business software instances (Salesforce, Netsuite, Dell Boomi)
- **IT Systems Administrator** at NC State Physics Department
