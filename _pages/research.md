## Magnetohydrodynamics of Core-Collapse Supernovae

My doctoral research investigates the magnetohydrodynamics of 3D core-collapse supernovae. Using high-fidelity simulations on distributed HPC systems, I explore how turbulent plasma flow and magnetic fields influence the explosion mechanism of massive stars.

### Key Research Areas

**Turbulence in Supernovae:**
Understanding the role of turbulent convection and instabilities in driving supernova explosions.

**Magnetic Field Evolution:**
Investigating how magnetic fields are amplified and evolve during core collapse, including the interplay between magnetic fields and vorticity.

**Numerical Methods:**
Developing and adapting numerical solvers for nonlinear PDEs with constraint-preserving methods, including enforcing magnetic field divergence-free boundary conditions (∇·B = 0) on 3D Cartesian grids.

### Technical Approach

**Simulation Code:**
- High-fidelity MHD FORTRAN 3D supernova code
- Distributed computing on HPC clusters using MPI
- Optimized for scalability on thousands of cores

**Data Analysis:**
- Python-based analysis pipelines (NumPy, SciPy, mpi4py)
- Large-scale data visualization
- Statistical analysis of turbulent flows

## Technical Skills

**Programming Languages:** Python, FORTRAN, C++, MATLAB, CUDA, Bash

**HPC & Parallel Computing:** MPI, OpenMP, OpenACC, distributed computing

**Scientific Computing:** Numerical methods, PDEs/ODEs, data visualization, statistical analysis

**Tools:** Docker, Git, Linux, VS Code
