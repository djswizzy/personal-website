## Magnetohydrodynamics of Core-Collapse Supernovae

My doctoral research investigates the magnetohydrodynamics of 3D core-collapse supernovae. Using high-fidelity simulations on distributed HPC systems, I explore how turbulent plasma flow and magnetic fields influence the explosion mechanism of massive stars.

### Key Research Areas

**Turbulence in Supernovae:**
Understanding the role of turbulent convection and instabilities in driving supernova explosions. My simulations reveal how turbulent energy cascades affect the shock dynamics and explosion energetics.

**Magnetic Field Evolution:**
Investigating how magnetic fields are amplified and evolve during core collapse. This includes studying the interplay between magnetic fields and vorticity, and how these dynamics affect the explosion mechanism.

**Numerical Methods:**
Developing and adapting numerical solvers for nonlinear PDEs with constraint-preserving methods. This includes enforcing magnetic field divergence-free boundary conditions (∇·B = 0) on 3D Cartesian grids.
