## Dissertation

**A study of Magnetic Fields and Stellar Evolution on Core-Collapse Supernovae**

Ph.D. Dissertation, UC Berkeley & North Carolina State University (December 2025)

This dissertation explores the role of magnetic fields and stellar evolution on the explosion mechanism of massive stars, using state-of-the-art 3D MHD simulations and 1D parameter studies.
