Work Experience
======

**Supernova Physicist** (2019 - 2025)  
*UC Berkeley & NC State University* - Berkeley, CA & Raleigh, NC
* Utilized a high-fidelity MHD FORTRAN 3D supernova code on distributed HPC systems to explore the role of turbulent plasma flow in supernova evolution
* Developed and implemented Python scripts to perform data analysis and generate plots used in publications
* Developed expertise in MHD and plasma dynamics through literature review and modeling experience
* Adapted numerical solvers for nonlinear PDEs with constraint preserving methods to enforce magnetic field divergence-free boundary conditions

**App Developer - Independent Contract** (2025)  
*Kondra Chemical* - San Francisco, CA
* Designed, built, tested, and delivered a LabView app for measurement of chemical concentration in water samples
* Developed hardware control, spectrometer data acquisition, and concentration interpolation modules

**Software Engineer** (2024 - Present)  
*KOINSLOT Inc.* - San Francisco, CA
* Contributed to Kywy, a handheld "low-code" educational coding device
* Developed complete games, custom rotation algorithms for sprite rendering, and asset-generation scripts in C++

**Business Systems Analyst** (2018 - 2019)  
*Insightsoftware* - Raleigh, NC
* Planned and executed data migrations for multiple acquired companies on short timescales
* Leveraged SQL and SOQL to perform data migrations into Salesforce from previous CRM systems

**IT Systems Administrator** (January 2015 - May 2018)  
*North Carolina State University* - Raleigh, NC
* Co-managed IT operations for the Physics Department at NC State University as one of two team members
* Implemented test environments in Docker and gained fluency in Linux

## Leadership

### Mentoring

- Mentored an undergraduate researcher on an original project in the [N3AS program](https://n3as.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. Investigated the effects of changing the beta decay rates of nuclei on the nucleosynthetic yields of a neutron star merger simulation.
- Trained several junior graduate students on FORTRAN, Python, and HPC environments.

### Teaching

- **Tutoring**: Privately tutored high school and undergraduate students in physics and math for 8 years.
- **Teaching**: Taught undergraduate courses in electromagnetism and astronomy.

### Community

- **Graduate Physics Student Association (GPSA)**: President for 3 years
- **Graduate Research Symposium Planning Committee**: Founding member
- **DEI Committee**: Founding member, served for 3 years


## Science Communication

### Public Talks

- **Astronomy on Tap** —  Oakland, CA 
- **Astronomy on Tap** —  Durham, NC
- **Astronomy Days** - Science Museum, Raleigh, NC

### Outreach

- **Raleigh Astronomy Club**: Led public telescope observations and taught members of the public about astronomy.
- **Local Middle School Astronomy Outreach**: Attended local middle schools in Raleigh, NC to teach students about solar activity and sunspots, as well as show them a live demonstration of sunspots with a solar-filtered telescope.
