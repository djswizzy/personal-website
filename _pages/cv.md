Work Experience
======

**Supernova Physicist** (2019 - 2025)  
*UC Berkeley & NC State University* - Berkeley, CA & Raleigh, NC
* Utilized a high-fidelity MHD FORTRAN 3D supernova code on distributed HPC systems to explore the role of turbulent plasma flow in supernova evolution
* Developed and implemented Python scripts to perform data analysis and generate plots used in publications
* Developed expertise in MHD and plasma dynamics through literature review and modeling experience
* Adapted numerical solvers for nonlinear PDEs with constraint preserving methods to enforce magnetic field divergence-free boundary conditions

**App Developer - Independent Contract** (2025)  
*Kondra Chemical* - San Francisco, CA
* Designed, built, tested, and delivered a LabView app for measurement of chemical concentration in water samples
* Developed hardware control, spectrometer data acquisition, and concentration interpolation modules

**Software Engineer** (2024 - Present)  
*KOINSLOT Inc.* - San Francisco, CA
